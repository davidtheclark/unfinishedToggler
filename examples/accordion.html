    <h2>Basic Accordion, Grouped</h2>

        <h3 class="accordion-trigger uft-trigger">First accordion item</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content uft-content">
          Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.

      <div class="accordion-group uft-group">
        <h3 class="accordion-trigger uft-trigger">Second accordion item</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content uft-content">
          There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-group uft-group">
        <h3 class="accordion-trigger uft-trigger">Third accordion item</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content uft-content">
          <p>Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
