<div id="tabs">

  <button id="second-tab"  class="uft-trigger uft-off" data-uft-group="2">Second</button>
  <button id="third-tab"  class="uft-trigger uft-off" data-uft-group="3">Third</button>

      <h3>First</h3>
      <p><a href="#">Test anchor</a> This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? </p>
    </section>
    <section class="uft-content tab-content uft-off" data-uft-group="2">
      <h3>Second</h3>
      <p><button href="#">Test anchor</button> That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="uft-content tab-content uft-off" data-uft-group="3">
      <h3>Third</h3>
      <p><a href="#">Test anchor</a> With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.</p>
